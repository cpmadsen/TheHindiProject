## The Hindi Project

I set the goal for myself at the end of 2024 to **learn Hindi** - so, naturally, it's mid-March and I haven't made much progress yet.

Let's talk about the goal:

### Goal(s)

<div style = "font-size:x-large">Achieve A2 or B1 in Hindi</div>

<div onclick="show_bit('a2_bits')>What is A2?</div>

<div id = 'a2_bits' style = 'visibility:hidden'>

</div>

<div onclick="show_bit('b1_bits')">What is B1?</div>

<div id = 'b1_bits' style = 'visibility:hidden'>

Language Fluency:

    a. Discuss your personal and professional hopes and dreams for the future.
    
    b. Arrange a job interview and interview for a job in your area of expertise.
    
    c. Talk about your television viewing habits and favorite programs.

    d. Describe your education and your plans for future training.

    e. Talk about your favorite music and music trends and plan a night out to listen to live music.
     
    f. talk about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and give and get advice about healthy habits.
  
    g. talk about relationships and dating, including meeting people through social media.

    h. Go to a restaurant, order food, engage in polite dinner conversation and pay for your food.

    i. participate in negotiations in your area of expertise, if you have help understanding some points.

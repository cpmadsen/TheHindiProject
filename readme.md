# The Hindi Project :notebook:

I set the goal for myself at the end of 2024 to **learn Hindi** - so, naturally, it's mid-March and I haven't made much progress yet. 

Let's talk about the goal:

## Achieve A2 or B1 in Hindi

These are quite advanced linguistic levels to achieve. See details below.

### What is A2? The ability to:

    a. evaluate coworkers' performance in the workplace.
    b. relate events from your past, including your weekend activities and interesting stories.
    c. describe your past life, giving details about important milestones.
    d. entertain someone in your home or visit a friend or colleague in their home.
    e. discuss your vacation plans and tell friends and colleagues about your vacation afterwards.
    f. talk about the natural world and travels to see animals and natural areas in your country.
    g. talk about movies that you like and choose a movie to see with friends.
    h. discuss clothing and what kind of clothes you like to wear.
    i. engage in basic communication at work, including attending meetings on familiar topics.
    j. describe an accident or injury, get medical help from a doctor and fill a prescription for medicine.
    k. engage in basic business socializing, welcoming guests and attending networking events.
    l. understand and make basic business proposals in your area of expertise.
    m. talk about and explain the rules of games.

### What is B1? The ability to:

    a. Discuss your personal and professional hopes and dreams for the future.
    b. Arrange a job interview and interview for a job in your area of expertise.
    c. Talk about your television viewing habits and favorite programs.
    d. Describe your education and your plans for future training.
    e. Talk about your favorite music and music trends and plan a night out to listen to live music.
    f. Talk about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and give and get advice about healthy habits.
    g. Talk about relationships and dating, including meeting people through social media.
    h. Go to a restaurant, order food, engage in polite dinner conversation and pay for your food.
    i. Participate in negotiations in your area of expertise, if you have help understanding some points.
    j. Discuss workplace safety issues, report an injury and explain rules and regulations.
    k. Discuss polite behavior and respond appropriately to impolite behavior.

I have already learned more or less how to read the Hindi script *Devanagari*. If you would like to follow this outline, **learning the script should be your first step**. It's tough but doable and should take you less than a month if you chip away at it every day. Duolingo is quite good for learning the script, or Rupert Snell's Teach Yourself Hindi, or any of the many youtube videos on this topic.

Once you've become familiar with most of the commonly used characters / letters, it's time to gather motivation, collect resources, and start to complete practice sessions (or, "bricks").

### Gathering Motivation :raised_hands: :muscle:

1. Watch Youtube videos about language learning.

    a. [Lamont in Days And Words](https://www.youtube.com/@daysandwords)

    b. [Language Lords](https://www.youtube.com/@languagelords)

#### Movies and Television shows :tv:

As Lamont demonstrates in his youtube video ["I learned Spanish watching Spiderman 50 times"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eliB_y0fmSk&ab_channel=DaysandWords), there is great benefit in watching content many, many times. Ideally, content should be watched more than 10 times. To pull this off, the content should be enjoyable *even without full comprehension* - animated movies are quite good for this.

1. [Spiderman - Across the Spider-verse](https://hdmovie2.observer/31869-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse.html)

2. [Austin Powers - Goldmember](https://vidply.com/e/wsuv0h9i7c4f)

### Building the House Brick by Brick :yen:

What could one study session consist of? Let's say:

1. 10+ Anki flashcards reviewed.
2. 10+ minutes of a movie or television show. 
3. Read one dialogue or page of a book in one of the books/textbooks.

### Calendar of Study

I don't expect myself to study every day; this calendar is just to help keep me accountable.
